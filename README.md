# IA_Sust-model
This repository contains the IA_Sust model. An ABM for industrial symbiosis management in industrial parks. Data is divided in two files:

(1) "Code model extract AI_Sust model.txt" which contains some parts of the code built for some sub-models of the ABM. 
(2) "Raw data IP_Juanchito sample.xlsx" which contains a sample of the companies' database with information on raw materials, 
energy consumption, water, waste generated, among others. The complete database must be requested from the environmental authority Corpocaldas,
who is the owner of the rights to share the information of the companies about the consumption of materials (www.corpocaldas.gov.co). 
Information with the materials and products prices can be found on the DANE website and can be freely downloaded. (www.dane.gov.co)
